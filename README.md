## Getting Started

### Installation

1) Install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) on your system, this tool will be used for video conversion and adding subtitles.

2) Go for the [latest release](https://github.com/Matheus-0/LookMovie-DL/releases/latest) and download the executable file for your system.

### Usage

Just open the executable file, the program itself is simple to understand. The movies and TV shows will be saved at the same directory as the executable file.

You will also need a video player with support to subtitles like VLC for PC or MX Player for cellphones in order to see them.
